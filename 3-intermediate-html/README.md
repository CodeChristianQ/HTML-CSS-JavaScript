# Intermediate HTML

This section dives deeper into essential HTML concepts by exploring how to better organize, link, and enrich web pages using a variety of elements. I also completed a mini-project applying what I learned.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- **List Elements (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)**  
  Used for creating unordered and ordered lists with nested items.

- **Nesting & Indentation**  
  Improved code readability and structure through proper HTML nesting.

- **Anchor Elements (`<a>`)**  
  Linked between internal and external pages with attributes like `href`, `target`, and `rel`.

- **Image Elements (`<img>`)**  
  Embedded images with attributes like `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height`.

## ðŸ§ª Project

### ðŸŽ‰ [Birthday Invite Project](./project-folder-path)
Created a simple birthday invitation webpage using:
- Lists
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Links
- Images

## ðŸ’¡ Bonus Tips

- Built-in productivity advice on using a **calendar-based habit tracker** to stay consistent.
- Reminder to subscribe to App Breweryâ€™s newsletter for continued learning support.

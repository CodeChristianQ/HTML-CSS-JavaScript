<!-- This file demonstrates the use of heading elements in HTML.
Understanding that headings are hierarchical is crucial for structuring content effectively.
Each heading level from `<h1>` to `<h6>` has a specific purpose and size.
The following example illustrates the use of different heading levels: -->
<h1>Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<h3>Section 1</h3>
<h3>Section 2</h3>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<h3>Section 1</h3>
<h4>Diagram 1</h4>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<h3>Section 1</h3>
<h3>Section 2</h3>

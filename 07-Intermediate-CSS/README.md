# Section 7 – Intermediate CSS

This section focused on advancing my CSS knowledge by exploring more complex styling concepts, selector combinations, positioning techniques, and applying them in a hands-on project.

## Topics Covered

1. **The Cascade – Specificity and Inheritance**  
   Learned how CSS decides which rules apply when there are conflicts. Explored specificity calculation, inline styles, `!important`, and inheritance behavior.

2. **Combining CSS Selectors**  
   Practiced combining selectors to target multiple elements more efficiently, including descendant, child, sibling, and grouping selectors.

3. **CSS Positioning**  
   Learned about `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed` positioning, along with stacking contexts and how elements are layered using `z-index`.

4. **[Project] CSS Flag**  
   Applied positioning and CSS layout techniques to create a flag using pure CSS, reinforcing the concepts of layering and element placement.

## Skills Gained
- Mastery of CSS specificity rules
- Efficient use of combined selectors
- Strong understanding of positioning and layout control
- Ability to create structured designs using only CSS

## Project Preview
The **CSS Flag Project** demonstrates precise positioning, layering, and styling without using images for the main design elements.
